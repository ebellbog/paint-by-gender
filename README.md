# Paint by Gender

A digital coloring book, which challenges players to paint inside the lines, while using a brush shape that doesn't always match the surrounding geometry. The experience is intended to evoke the often oppressive nature of gender norms.

This game is a work in progress, originally started at the Recurse Center in 2018.
